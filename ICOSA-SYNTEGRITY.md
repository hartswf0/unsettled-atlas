# ICOSA SYNTEGRITY

`icosa-syntegrity.html` — a fork of `icosa-world.html`, kept separate so the
instrument stays intact.

> Every triangle on Earth has an address, a council and a thread.

## What was wrong

`icosa-world` is a good map and an empty one. A cell had an id and an edge
length and nothing else. Everything that felt like a toy followed from that
one fact:

- The council read as arbitrary categories, because there was nothing in the
  triangle for a council to be about.
- The panels covering the map did not seem to cost anything, because there
  was nothing underneath worth not covering.
- Nothing could be sent to anyone. A triangle you cannot link to is a
  triangle you cannot cite, argue about, or return to.
- The registers — coordinate, body, record, absence, category, recursion —
  were an honest way to avoid fabricating residents, and an evasion. They
  described *how* one might speak about a place without anyone actually
  speaking.

## What changed

**The triangle has an address.** Corners and centre in degrees, area by
spherical excess (a root face comes out at 25.50 million km², a twentieth of
the Earth, which is the check that the arithmetic is real), the three
neighbours, the parent, the four children, and what the source set says is
inside it. The address is `F13.21` and it lives in the URL, so a triangle
can be linked, bookmarked and cited. Reload and you are back on the same
ground.

**The map is never covered.** The sheet is a sibling of the map, not a lid
on it: on a phone the map keeps the upper half, on a wide screen the sheet
takes a column, and the map re-measures either way. You can read a panel
about a triangle while looking at the triangle.

**A seat is held by a person.** The council still comes from the geometry —
the solid, the seats, the antipodal critic — but no seat has an occupant
until someone types their name into it. Nothing simulates a resident,
because nothing needs to: the only way a seat speaks is if a person takes
it. Your critic is the seat opposite yours and it is a person too, named on
the map along its strut.

**The conversation is on the map.** Say something and it stays on the
triangle you said it about, drawn there as a mark with a count. A note
attached to a council seat is drawn at that seat's topic, so an argument
sits on the point it is about. The record is kept in this browser under
`icosa.syn.v1` and leaves as a file — no server, no account, so a
conversation is something you carry rather than something you are lent, and
two records merge by import.

## What it still does not do

Being plain about this, because the gap is the interesting part.

- **Below about 6 km the record runs out.** The source is Natural Earth
  110m. The triangles keep subdividing and the contents do not, so a block
  council convenes over an address with nothing in it. A gazetteer —
  Wikidata heritage sites, OSM `historic`/`heritage`, with source ids — is
  the next thing that matters, and it cannot be fetched from this
  environment: `query.wikidata.org` and `overpass-api.de` are both refused
  by the egress policy here.
- **No model writes anything.** Deliberately, and still. A council of real
  people over a grounded dossier is worth building; a council of synthetic
  voices over an empty one is the thing the whole project exists to
  criticise.
- **The record is local.** Two people in the same room can each hold a seat
  and merge records by file. Two people in different rooms cannot yet.
- **`icosa-world.html` is unchanged.** It remains the instrument: the
  geometry, the fold, the invariants, the compiled councils. This fork is
  where the argument about consequence happens.

## Grammar

Everything from `icosa-world`, plus:

- **tap the address plate** — corners, area, contents, and the link
- **WHERE** — the same, from the action ring
- **SAID** — the thread on this triangle, and the field to add to it
- **COUNCIL** — the seats, each one claimable by name

The compiled geometry, the solid family and the register assignment all come
from `icosa-world.data.js` unchanged. See `ICOSA-WORLD.md` for how those are
derived.
